# **App Name**: Passion Path

## Core Features:

- Passion Input: Users can input between 3 to 6 passions to explore.
- 6Ps Journey Forms: Guide users through the 6Ps framework (Passion, Purpose, Power, Proof, Problems, Possibilities) for each entered passion.  Each P is captured using forms.
- Purpose Forms with Weighting: In the 'Purpose' phase, allow users to input three purpose statements and assign relative importance weights (High, Medium, Low) to each.
- Dynamic Form Population: In subsequent forms, populate fields with the user's previous answers to create a streamlined experience.
- Passion Ranking: Rank passions based on a score calculated from user inputs and assigned weights in each phase, especially considering Problems as detractors. Uses 'high' (6 points), 'medium' (4 points), 'low' (2 points) weighting to compute an overall score for each passion.
- Landing Page with Video: Include a landing page with introductory content and a video explainer, using this link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzzs5vrE5e0&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fqudraat.com%2F
